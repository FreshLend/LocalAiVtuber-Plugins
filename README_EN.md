# LocalAiVtuber Plugins and Fixes
Plugins and Fixes for [Local Ai Vtuber](https://github.com/0Xiaohei0/LocalAIVtuber)

## Installer:
- run.bat - Simple installation and launch with the ability to download fixes and plugins from this repository

## Fixes:
- Replaced the LangSegment library with a working version from GitHub in LocalAiVtuber/fixes/requirements.txt, as the previous one caused errors.

## Plugins:
- Silero+RVC - Same as the pre-installed RVC but fully local due to using Silero instead of Edge_tts

- NLLBTranslator - A local translator supporting up to 200 languages with auto-detection capability (The plugin doesn't include all languages, only the most popular ones - 39 languages).
